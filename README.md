# Sticky

Create an account Make sticky notes and access them through the web!

The main reason I built this app for web and not mobile was for quick, easy and global access to any reminders or to-dos without the hassle of having to download software on multiple devices.

### How To Use
Once logged into an account press the '+' button to create a sticky note. 

Notes will save to the database when you press the blue icon on the bottom left of a sticky

Deleting a note will remove it from the database so becareful.
